    <p><br>Come back 

        <br>In  my dreams, your presence lingers, a haunting refrain
        <br>A bittersweet reminder of what we could not sustain
        <br>My mind, a canvas, painted with memories of you
        <br>A masterpiece of moments, both sweet and true
        
        <br>Come back, and let us weave a new shade
        <br>One threaded with laughter, tears, and ecstasy
        <br> Perhaps, this time, our love will find its way
        <br>Through the complex of heartache, to a brighter day
        
        <br>Your departure left an ache, a hollowed-out space
        <br>A silence that screams louder than any embrace
        <br>Why did you leave? The question echoes through my mind
        <br>A mystery that only time and truth can unwind
        
        <br> Come back, and let us rewrite our story’s end
        <br>One that concludes with joy, not sorrow’s trend
        <br> My heart, a vessel, yearns to be filled anew
        <br>With the love we shared, and the dreams we once pursued
        
        <br>Please come back, and let our love shine bright
        <br>A beacon in the darkness, guiding us through the night</p>
